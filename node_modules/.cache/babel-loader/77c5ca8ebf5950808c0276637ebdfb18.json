This file looks a lot like the same-day-sets file, except that\nit has exactly two numbers per row.  You simply place on each row the row numbers of a pair\nof students who want to be scheduled on different days.  For example, if Cindy Halvah and \nMohammad Talwar are such a pair, add row\n\n<code>8 7 </code>\n\nIf John Smith and Sunil Chopra are another another such pair, add row\n\n<code>1 10</code>\n\nSave as CSV into something like \"different_day_pairs.csv\".  In this example, the 2-line file to be\nuploaded would be \n\n<code>8,7</code>\n<code>1,10</code>\n\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                SUBMITTING YOUR DATA\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                After reviewing your data on the Review page, click Submit.  The code will need up to 15 minutes.\n                At completion, it will send you an e-mail.  The e-mail will contain the schedule,\n                presuming (as is usually the case) it found\n                one.  If it failed to find one, there was probably a mistake in your data, either in the\n                quantities you entered by hand or in the files you uploaded.  In most but not all cases,\n                Schedyool will describe the error, but in some cases you will have to examine the data you entered\n                and find the error yourself.  In rare cases, Schedyool might even fail to find a schedule, if, for\n                example, your scheduling problem is too difficult, even when there is no error in the data.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                HOW TO INTERPRET THE E-MAIL\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                If Schedyool found a schedule, it will appear as the CSV attachment \"schedule.csv\" to the e-mail.\n                This attachment corresponds to the textual output which appears in the body of the e-mail.  File\n                schedule.csv will have four columns.  The first is the student number, from students_with_names.csv;\n                the second is that student's grade level;  the third is the day on which the student will attend\n                school (more about this in a moment); and the last is the classroom number.\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                The \"day\" is really the \"schedule.\"  For example, for Monday-Tuesday and alternate Wednesdays\n                vs Thursday-Friday and alternate Wednesdays, \"day 1\" means the former and \"day 2\" means the latter.\n            </Typography>\n            <Link href=\"/scheduler\">\n                <Controls.Button text=\"Schedyool!\" />\n            </Link>\n            <Link href=\"/\">\n                <Controls.Button text=\"Home\" color=\"default\" />\n            </Link>\n        </Page>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Home;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
