Each row will correspond to a classroom available every\n                day for blended learning.\n\n                The first column will contain the line numbers, as above.\n                In the second column, place the name of the classroom, like \"Room 128\", and in the third, place\n                its \"socially-distanced\" student capacity, like 10.  (Remember to deduct for\n                teachers.)  There must be exactly one row for each\n                classroom and no header row.  Call that sheet \"room_capacities_with_names\".\n\n                Then copy only the *third* column of that sheet to a new sheet.\n                Then save the last sheet alone as a CSV file, as you did above, ignoring the\n                warnings from Excel.  Call that CSV file something like \"room_capacities_without_names\", to which\n                a \".csv\" extension will be added.  This is the room capacity file you will upload to Schedyool.\n\n                EXAMPLE.\n\n                Here is a sample 7-line room_capacities_without_names.csv file, for a school with 7 classrooms.\n\n                10\n                8\n                12\n                12\n                11\n                7\n                9\n\n                There are two more files to upload.  They are not difficult.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                THE SAME-DAY SETS FILE\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n\n                You likely have some sets of students who want to be scheduled on the same day.  Perhaps\n                some of your sets are sets of siblings and some are \"learning pods.\"  You will now create a file\n                containing one line for each such set.  In this file, we represent a student\n                by the number of the row in which the student appears in the students_with_names file.\n                For example, look at the sample students_with_names.csv file above.\n                Suppose that John Smith and Kareem Smith are siblings who should be scheduled\n                on the same day.  Then add to the same-day sets file the row\n\n<code>1  6</code>\n\nwith the 1 in the first column, the 6, in the second,\nbecause John Smith is student 1 and Kareem Smith is student 6.\nIf Letitia Williams, Mohammad Talwar, and Carla Chan are in a learning pod together and\ndesire to be scheduled together, add row\n\n<code>3  7  9</code>\n\nwith the 9 in the third column.\n(The numbers in a row actually do not have to be in sorted order.)  As you can see,\ndifferent rows in this file can have different numbers of entries.\nShould Sunil Chopra and Bill Friend be friends who want to be scheduled on the same row, add row\n\n<code>10  4</code>\n\nNow save this spreadsheet as CSV (not as Excel) into something like \"same_day_sets.csv\".\nIn CSV format, the file will have three lines and will look like this:\n\n<code>1,6</code>\n                <code>3,7,9</code>\n                <code>10,4</code>\n\nThis is the same-day-sets file you will upload to Schedyool.\n\n            </Typography>\n\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                THE DIFFERENT DAY PAIRS FILE\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                Last, you must upload a different-day-pairs file, for pairs of students who want to be\n                scheduled on different days.  This file looks a lot like the same-day-sets file, except that\n                it has exactly two numbers per row.  You simply place on each row the row numbers of a pair\n                of students who want to be scheduled on different days.  For example, if Cindy Halvah and\n                Mohammad Talwar are such a pair, add row\n\n<code>8 7 </code>\n\nIf John Smith and Sunil Chopra are another another such pair, add row\n\n<code>1 10</code>\n\nSave as CSV into something like \"different_day_pairs.csv\".  In this example, the 2-line file to be\nuploaded would be\n\n<code>8,7</code>\n                <code>1,10</code>\n\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                SUBMITTING YOUR DATA\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                After reviewing your data on the Review page, click Submit.  The code will need up to 15 minutes.\n                At completion, it will send you an e-mail.  The e-mail will contain the schedule,\n                presuming (as is usually the case) it found\n                one.  If it failed to find one, there was probably a mistake in your data, either in the\n                quantities you entered by hand or in the files you uploaded.  In most but not all cases,\n                Schedyool will describe the error, but in some cases you will have to examine the data you entered\n                and find the error yourself.  In rare cases, Schedyool might even fail to find a schedule, if, for\n                example, your scheduling problem is too difficult, even when there is no error in the data.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                HOW TO INTERPRET THE E-MAIL\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                If Schedyool found a schedule, it will appear as the CSV attachment \"schedule.csv\" to the e-mail.\n                This attachment corresponds to the textual output which appears in the body of the e-mail.  File\n                schedule.csv will have four columns.  The first is the student number, from students_with_names.csv;\n                the second is that student's grade level;  the third is the day on which the student will attend\n                school (more about this in a moment); and the last is the classroom number.\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                The \"day\" is really the \"schedule.\"  For example, for Monday-Tuesday and alternate Wednesdays\n                vs Thursday-Friday and alternate Wednesdays, \"day 1\" means the former and \"day 2\" means the latter.\n            </Typography>\n            <Link href=\"/scheduler\">\n                <Controls.Button text=\"Schedyool!\" />\n            </Link>\n            <Link href=\"/\">\n                <Controls.Button text=\"Home\" color=\"default\" />\n            </Link>\n        </Page>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Home;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
