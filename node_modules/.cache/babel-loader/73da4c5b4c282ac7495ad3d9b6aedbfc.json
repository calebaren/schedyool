If it failed to find one, there was probably a mistake in your data, either in the\n                quantities you entered by hand or in the files you uploaded.  In most but not all cases,\n                Schedyool will describe the error, but in some cases you will have to examine the data you entered\n                and find the error yourself.  In rare cases, Schedyool might even fail to find a schedule, if, for\n                example, your scheduling problem is too difficult, even when there is no error in the data.\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"h5\">\n                HOW TO INTERPRET THE E-MAIL\n            </Typography>\n\n            <Typography paragraph variant=\"body2\">\n                If Schedyool found a schedule, it will appear as the CSV attachment \"schedule.csv\" to the e-mail.\n                This attachment corresponds to the textual output which appears in the body of the e-mail.
